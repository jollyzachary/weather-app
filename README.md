# Snow: Weather App

## Overview
Snow is a user-friendly weather application that provides real-time weather forecasts and climate insights. Whether you need to check the weather for travel, work, or just daily planning, Snow is here to help. This project acts as the final project build for my (Zachary) CourseCareers.com software developer course. The weather app is built in react.js and utilizes both a javascript fetch method for city data, and a GO backend api to request data for the weather pertaining to the searched city.
